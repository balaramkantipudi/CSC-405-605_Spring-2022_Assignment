# CSC-405-605_Spring-2022_Assignment

I took CSC-605 course in UNCG for Spring 2022 semester, as part of the course work below are the assignments I did.

**Assignment 1:** 

*Create a ipython notebook of random team generator based on the .tsv file supplied. 
The program should be able to generate teams based on the number of teams provided as a variable without using advanced libraries such as Pandas or Numpy.*

Hint: Use csv library to read the file into a list (and/or dictionary) and list comprehensions with random selection without replacement.
