Assignment 1 is to create a ipython notebook of random team generator based on the .tsv file supplied. 
The program should be able to generate teams based on the number of teams provided as a variable without using advanced libraries such as Pandas or Numpy.

Hint: Use csv library to read the file into a list (and/or dictionary) and list comprehensions with random selection without replacement.
