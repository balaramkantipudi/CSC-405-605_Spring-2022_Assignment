Input : User should only enter integer which is number teams

Output : Student names with teams

Step 1: Import required libraries

Step 2: Read TSV files with help of csv reader from path

Step 3: Remove first column as its just heading. By removing the 0th position the heading will be removed.

Step 4: Find the size of class by len() method.

Step 5: Take input from the user which is to be a integer, so type casting with keyword int.

Step 6: Create an empty list

Step 7: Append a number which is each team should have at minimum in that list

Step 8: Now find the remainder number of students in class by modulus operation

Step 9: Now add the remaining students to each group to one by one from the beginning so that no one will be left.

Step 10: Now the list contains how many members does a team should contain

Step 11: Use a method called as random.sample() which generates random things in that range and add that to another list say stu

Step 12: Print the team

Step 13: Remove the students from the main students list so that students wont repeat from that use remove() in for loop.

Step 14: Clear the list stu so that students from previous team won't repeat.

Step 15: Add for loop before random.sample() method, so that it will run till all the teams are generated.

Note: Need to change path before providing the file.
